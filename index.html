<p>
My name is Candice, and I am a lifelong learner with a zeal for developing solutions to complex problems. I graduated Cum Laude from Florida Gulf Coast University with a B.S. in Economics in 2014. Since graduating, I have had the opportunity to work at Allstate as both a manager and senior agent, at Gartner’s as an account manager, and most recently at Georgia Tech as an economic analyst. These positions have given me a broad knowledge of data manipulation, data cleaning, data joining, web scraping, API querying, the business model, relationship management, data analysis, time management, forecasting ,business report creating, and effective teamwork.
</p>
<p>
In March of 2017, I recognized my passion is in problem-solving and decided to change my career path to become an analyst. I made the difficult decision to leave Gartner in order to develop the quantitative background to enter the analyst field. After 18 months of prerequisites, I was accepted to Georgia Tech for their M.S. of Economics program, and was one of three students chosen for a fellowship as a graduate research assistant. I have since graduated in August 2019 with a 3.6 GPA, and have started my career as a data analyst.
</P>
My current role is a mixture of data analytics and process management. Half of my time is dedicated to health economics research, working with large data sets (> 1,000,000 rows), cleaning/prepping the data, data manipulation, and joining data sets on key variables. I am proficient in SAS, SQL, and Python. I also directly manage 6 graduate and undergraduate students who work in the lab. In efforts to make the lab more efficient, I have developed training plans, a project management system, and cultivate relationships with other Georgia Tech departments for collaboration opportunities.
<p>
I am always learning new coding languages and functionalities within the languages I currently use. Most recently I enrolled at Georgia Tech's Coding Boot Camp. I have learned how to query data through APIs and expanded my knowledge of a wide range of coding languages.  I enjoy the complexity and preciseness of coding, it is like a puzzle that requires both creativity and adhering to the rules of the program.
</p>
As for who I am on a personal level, I am someone who loves fun, laughter, cats, economics, and running (I recognize the last one is contradictory to both fun and laughter, but life is an enigma.) I am always learning, enjoy working with others, and while I strive to be the best I can be, I try not to take life too seriously.
